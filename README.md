# What Did They Modify?

Most people who mod gtag fan games and similar unity based games use the method of disabling or enabling GameObjects within the apk. This tool allows you to see what GameObjects were modified within an apk.

Also useful to see reverse the config for [My AutoModder](https://github.com/twhlynch/AutoModder)

`python WDTM.py game.apk modded.apk`

> - Wont work for anything other than enabling/disabling objects
> - Won't work if they are different versions of the game
